        <p>The microwave oven is a machine that can take cold or 
          uncooked food and transform it into something hot or edible. 
          Its interface consists of a door that gives the user access to the 
          cooking chamber as well as a side panel with buttons that allow 
          the user to manipulate the temperature and time for which the food 
          will be heated. In this project, I aim to discover the utility and 
          accessibility of the microwave, putting user-centered design principles 
          at the forefront of my research.</p>

            <h2 class="section_sub">Observation</h2>
            <p>I observed three people use a microwave, noting especially their 
            interactions with the interface’s key components.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
              All the users exhibited difficulty with opening the microwave door, 
              failing to push the open button all the way through before the whole 
              machine was nudged out of place.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two users microwaved already cooked food they had just taken out of 
              the refrigerator, while the third user microwaved a frozen appetizer.
            </li>
            <li>
              The users pressed an average of two buttons on the keypad, excluding 
              the door button.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two users used the microwave for a single item and heated it uninterrupted. 
              The third user heated multiple items and periodically opened the microwave 
              to touch the food. 
            </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        
          <div id="interview">
            <h2 class="section_sub">Interview</h2>
            <p>After observation, I asked the users the following questions.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>In general, for what reason do you use the microwave?</li>
              <li>Do you achieve your goal almost always, sometimes, or hardly ever?</li>
              <li>How often do you use the microwave throughout the day?</li>
              <li>In one single time and place, how many times do you use the microwave?</li>
              <li>What kinds of things do you microwave?</li>
              <li>Do you approach the interface differently depending on which kind of food you are heating?</li>
              <li>Which setting(s) do you alter the most on a case-by-case basis?</li>
              <li>Which buttons have you used before, and which ones do you use the most?</li>
              <li>Tell me one complaint you have about the microwave’s interface.</li>
              <li>Are there any other comments or suggestions you would like to make?</li>
            </ol>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div id="response">
            <h2 class="section_sub">Response</h2>
            <p>
              All three users reported using the microwave mostly to reheat leftovers, 
              with one user heating packaged frozen appetizers and dinners more often 
              than the other two. They operate the microwave on about two or three occasions 
              each day, averaging two uses per occasion. The users also detailed that they 
              approach the interface differently depending on which kind of food they are 
              heating; however, they mostly ever change the amount of time for which the 
              food is microwaved. None of the interviewees have used any button outside 
              of the number, start, and stop buttons — most of them citing that they simply 
              had no knowledge of how the other buttons affect the operation of the microwave. 
              Finally, all the users agreed that the door is very difficult to open and the 
              keypad hard to press. They postulated that a door handle (instead of an open 
              button) and keys with mechanical switches (instead of a flat keypad) would
              provide a more seamless experience with the microwave.

            My contextual inquiry led to two personas represented by empathy maps,

              <b>Meticulous Mandy</b> is a young professional with a demanding career. She 
              typically dedicates her weekends to cooking meals for the coming week, 
              relying on her trusty appliance to provide hot dinners. Her foremost issue 
              about the microwave is the door she still struggles to open during each use, 
              despite being a regular user. This persona highlights the users’ resounding 
              annoyance with the door’s open button, and it represents the users who remain 
              intrigued by the heat setting buttons on the keypad but never get around to using 
              them for the sake of ease.

              <b>Famished Fanny</b> is a college sophomore who usually spends their free time 
              cooking up solutions for their all too often hunger pangs. Although they use 
              the microwave for a wide range of cases aside from reheating food, they 
              think the numerous heat settings in the keypad are superfluous; they mostly just 
              stick to their usual 1- and 2-minute keys. This persona represents the users who 
              use the microwave as a kitchen tool rather than a simple reheating machine. It 
              also personifies the users who take issue with the accessibility of the keypad.

          <h1 class="section_title">Takeaways</h1>
          <p>
            This project encouraged me to ponder the accessibility of interfaces outside of 
            my own world view. By employing contextual inquiry to create personas and a 
            storyboard, I learned how to center my design and research on the user.
            <br>
            <br>
            One limitation of my process is my small sample size. Given a larger observation pool, 
            I would be able to perceive a wider range of user behavior and create more hollistic 
            personas. Moreover, I was unable to observe people in a public setting due to the 
            circumstances presented by the current pandemic. For future projects, stratifying my 
            sample size could also prove useful.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, this project illuminated the importance of behavioral data in user experience 
            research. I found myself regularly consulting my observations and my interviewees'
            responses. This project has primed me to tackle future projects with the tenets of 
            user-centered design.
